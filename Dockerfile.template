# RUN does a few things.  First, it runs the command given to it inside the container
# being built that will result in the image.  Second, however, it creates
# a "layer", which is essentially a cache of the current state of the image being 
# built.  That means, if we change something AFTER this RUN directive, this
# directive won't be re-executed—docker will pull the layer from a cache.
#
# This particular RUN directive is first because of what it does. It sets up
# the system software that's needed for everything else.  apt-get update
# refreshes the local cache of what software is available to install
# and then apt-get install pulls down packages and installs them.
